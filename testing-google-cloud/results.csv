AskReddit,"Growing up, my grandmother lived with us at my parents' house and helped raise me and my brother. She passed away when I was still in elementary school. She was also the only person in my immediate family who drank coffee, so after she died, we stopped keeping coffee in the house. On occasion, spots in my parents' house will smell strongly of coffee, as if someone had just poured a fresh cup, for a short period of time. It still happens, though much less frequently now that so many years have passed. About a year ago, I was sitting at the table in the kitchen, talking to my mother when it happened. It was as if someone had poured a cup of coffee and set it on the table in front of me. I said something about it to her (it had been her mother who lived with us) and she came over and agreed that I wasn't just imagining the smell. The coffee smell lingered for a while before fading away again.

AskReddit,"A lot of implausible stories in the bible, but mostly Noah’s ark. I literally went from being a devout Christian to an atheist in less than a day because I thought about Noah’s ark too hard.

Understanding how DNA works and that you need far more than just a pair of animals will not be a big enough gene pool for them to successfully repopulate (including Noah and his family. His sons brought their wives along, but they would still have to commit some type of incest eventually, and even then there wouldn’t be enough genetic diversity to continue the human race).

Also the fact that the dimensions of the ark (stated in the bible) are not nearly big enough for two of every species of animal.

Also the fact that that it’s not logistically possible for a lot of animals to travel long distances, including oceans, to get on this ark because god told them to.

Also the fact that torrential rain for forty days and nights would nearly be enough to cover the highest mountain, and even if it was, all plant life will die either because of drowning, drastic increase in pressure, and an inability to photosynthesise (sunlight can only penetrate so far into to ocean),  which would then lead to the mass extinction of the animals on board because no food.

Also somehow making sure the animals don’t eat each other.

Also somehow making sure they don’t die of hunger and thirst since they can’t drink the seawater either.

Also the fact that you would think that there would be physical evidence of this huge ark or some written or oral sources for an apocalyptic flood that virtually reset all life on Earth but..... like.... there isn’t? Yeah.",-0.20000000298023224,4.199999809265137
